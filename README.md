Our product will be a task list connected to the Google Calendar API.  
You will have the possebility to add tasks, set deadlines and mark tasks by importance. Tasks also come with options such as adding sub-tasks to create lists. 

The user will be able to log in to a mobile or web application to manage their tasks and deadlines, and will be able to share their task lists with other users.  

Our task list features a month- and day-view that quickly gives you a glimpse at what you need to do this month and the next. It will alert you when a deadline is near, and migrate unfinished tasks without deadlines.

Our project group has 12 story points per week.
